When utilized in coatings, ultrafine heavy carbonate offers better whiteness, ink absorption, and air permeability than kaolin. It is suitable to be used in base and surface coatings used on white cardboard and copper printing paper, and increases corrosion resistance, durability, and strength. It can significantly enhance the whiteness and smoothness of paper, reduce production costs by lessening the need for glue and whitener, and improve paper&#8217;s printing performance.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.7&#8243; collapsed=&#8221;on&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.4.7&#8243;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.7&#8243; text_font=&#8221;Lato|300|||||||&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; text_font_size=&#8221;20px&#8221; text_letter_spacing=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.4em&#8221; link_text_color=&#8221;#0c71c3&#8243; text_orientation=&#8221;justified&#8221; link_text_color__hover_enabled=&#8221;on|desktop&#8221; link_text_color__hover=&#8221;#e02b20&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cLarge scale mineral mining industry ensuring the supreme quality for a brighter tomorrow\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our aim has been to show you just a few of the applications of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/calcium-carbonate-2\/\">Calcium Carbonate<\/a> but there are many others we have not mentioned, some well-known, as well as others still to be discovered.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any doubts concerning the suitability of this product in your sector, contact the GMCI who in addition to being able to provide you with samples of our products, will provide personalized advice on their use and even develop the acceptable product for your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Because GMCI <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/products\/\">products<\/a> come from the environment where we aim at serving the high-performance minerals while emerging as a leader in the mineral manufacturing industry in the global market.
