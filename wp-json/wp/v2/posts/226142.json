It has the kaolinite as a primary constituent. However, the kaolinite is a hydrous aluminum silicate produced by the decomposition of granite minerals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Pure kaolinite often has a bright white color. In case it has a reddish or yellowish hue, this is due to the presence of iron oxide. Besides, it is rich in zinc, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, etc.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Kaolin has diverse applications in several products such as paint, paper, insulated cable as well as fertilizers. Though, kaolin is very popular in cosmetics and personal care products.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kaolin in Beauty Care and Cosmetics Products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kaolin is an excellent mineral that forms the <a href=\"#\">base of many beauty products<\/a>. However, when used in a specific form such as powder, it mixes with essential oils and other ingredients to create a <a href=\"#\">beauty product of pure elegance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The skincare products loaded with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/kaolin\/\">Kaolin<\/a> are <a href=\"#\">suitable for dry skins<\/a> as they possess strong absorbent characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>However, the <a href=\"#\">kaolin contains tiny particles<\/a> when it is available in the form of a powder that gives it the granular feature. This makes it a great ingredient to furnish the exfoliating products, specifically in the form of a <a href=\"#\">paste<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Being the softest clay, Kaolin clay does not absorb the skin&#8217;s own moisture and keeps the skin not turning red as compared to the bentonite clay or illite clay. Besides, the softness of <a href=\"#\">clay<\/a> makes it ideal for <a href=\"http:\/\/3\" data-wplink-url-error=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">childcare products<\/a> such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/talc\/\">talc<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the <a href=\"#\">kaolin has an anti-inflammatory influence<\/a>, which decreases the redness and inflammation of established blemishes. Kaolin is the primary ingredient of cosmetics products including face powder and the foundation. Its absorbent feature allows it to <a href=\"#\">soak the excess waterand oil<\/a> over the face that keeps the makeup not being caked.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Being an industry leader, GMCI has been providing the Kaolin to essential manufacturing businesses including cosmetics while adhering to the standards strictly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The basics you need to know about<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":225339,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[348],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-226142","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-skincare"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/226142"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=226142"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/226142\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":241199,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/226142\/revisions\/241199"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/225339"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=226142"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=226142"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=226142"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
