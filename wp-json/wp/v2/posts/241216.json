Precipitated Calcium Carbonate is produced by moisturizing high-calcium fast lime and then by reacting with carbon dioxide to the resultant slurry, or \u201clime milk.\u201d In the PCC process, substances varying from ultra-low to very high powder densities may be produced with very limited measurements, high surface areas, higher oil absorption and\/or specific powder bulk content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241219 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screenshot_30.png\" alt=\"calcium carbonate 1\" width=\"477\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screenshot_30.png 477w, https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screenshot_30-300x225.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As against the more expensive wood-pulp, additives or other minerals, PPC is the most <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">cost-effective mineral<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">producing high-quality paper and paperboard<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Because PCC is manufactured, its chemical and physical properties can be controlled. This means that the PCC produced, can have its properties optimized in terms of its particle size, particle size distribution, surface area, particle shape and surface chemistry to meet the needs of our customers. Also, synthesized PCC is also innately whiter and brighter than other raw minerals used in paper-making like kaolin clay and Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this, PCC is also used in the paper mills as a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">filler material <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the alkaline paper-making processes. The main reason behind the preference for PCC is also because of the increasing demands for brighter and bulkier papers. As against GCC, PCC provides <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">better gloss and opacity properties for the paper<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">, while also being less abrasive than GCC.\u00a0 Also, it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">increases the machine speed and productivity<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hence simultaneously improving the machine run ability and water drainage. Further on, it not only <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">improves the print quality <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but also reduces fibre consumption as compared to GCC or talc. The higher light scattering ability of PCC, compared to clay, made it possible for papermakers to achieve their opacity and brightness targets without TiO<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Lastly, it has more retention capacity than the other paper fillers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GMCI being the global manufacturing leader of industrial minerals based in Ahmedabad, India with a commitment to quality and proven track record of more than 14 years, produces and sells 100,000MT 200 meshes to 15000 meshes CaCo3(GCC, PCC, Nano Calcium Carbonate) powder each year. Believing in bridging the gap between quality of products, our product has the reputation of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;\">high whiteness and high purity<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The PCC powder is widely used in different industries, such as plastic, rubber, EVA, cable, paper, cosmetics, food, pharmaceutical and ceramics.
