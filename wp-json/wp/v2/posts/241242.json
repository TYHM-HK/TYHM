It is found as a major constituent of dolostones and dolomite marbles. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term is also used for sedimentary carbonate rock, mainly made up of the dolomite mineral. Dolostone is an alternate name used occasionally for the form of dolomite rock. Dolomite may be colorless, white, pinkish or slightly blue. On the other hand, the crystals of Dolomite may be either transparent, or translucent or even completely opaque. Dolomite is also one of those minerals which makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth\u2019s crust. Additionally, it is also that mineral which cleaves or breaks along smooth planes in three different directions. Collectively though, this barely makes the introduction of dolomite. To give you further insights:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolomite comes in at 3.5-4 on the Mohs hardness scale. This scale rates how difficult it is to scratch a mineral. Additionally, it is also a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double salt <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because it is composed of calcium as well as magnesium such that it has a structure different than either of those individual salts. In this mineral, the calcium and magnesium salts exist in separate layers with the carbonate layers in between them.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolomite is also used as a source of magnesia (MgO), a feed additive for livestock, a sintering agent and a flux in metal processing. It is also used as an ingredient in the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">production of bricks, glass<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ceramics.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolomite due to its reaction with the acid is also used for acid neutralization in the chemical industry, stream restoration projects and as a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">soil conditioner<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolomite powder is also used as a raw material in soap and detergents. In fact, when dolomite is free from iron, it is also used in making of sheet and optical glasses. On the other hand, dolomite marble chips are used for floorings.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the refractory lining in basic open-hearth furnaces and Bessemer converters, dead burned dolomite is used as refractory lining. It is also used as a basic flux in smelting of iron ore in blast furnace, hence removing alumina and slag. Lastly, it is also used in accelerating the vulcanizing process and in decorative building materials and polish. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, while dolomite is not a mineral with wide range of applications, but it is nevertheless is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a mineral of many secrets<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One that accommodates several of our vital uses, not limiting to dolomite serving as the host rock for many lead, zinc and copper deposits while also serving as the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reservoir for oil and gas<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At GMCI, dolomite powder has managed to win over large popularity due to the high level of whiteness and purity offered by us. We produce a dolomite powder that retains all of its physical properties of being less reactive, having better acid resistance, having better production rate and lastly, also one that increases the flow rates because of its higher bulk density and Sp. Gravity. All of our customers are duly assured and promised of timely deliveries of the quantities ordered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We, the GMCI are the producer, dealer and exporter of Dolomite powders in India.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dolomite- A mineral of many secrets Which mineral is GMCI the producer, exporter and dealer in India?
