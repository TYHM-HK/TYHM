While in China this clay was mostly used for making porcelain and also as a medicine for treating diarrhea, today, it is among the gentlest clay used in skin care. It is white in colour with a very soft texture. Depending upon the different minerals present in it, it can also be greenish or pinkish in colour, though the one which is white is said to be purer and better. It is rich in a mineral named as \u201cKaolinite.\u201d Kaolin clay has a neutral pH and is rich in silica dioxide. These properties mean that it is gentle on the skin while making it soft and healthy. But that is just a brief, for Kaolin is beneficial in cosmetics in several ways. Some of them are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tooth Cleanser<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Kaolin is a popular ingredient in tooth cleansing powder because of its ability to polish and hence whiten the appearance of the teeth. Additionally, because it is abundant in minerals, it can also become a way of remineralizing and strengthening the teeth. Most importantly, it is a completely natural source.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleanses Hair: Kaolin clay being gentle benefits dry, brittle hair by cleansing it of all the dirt, impurities and oil without stripping off the natural oils.

It hence also works as a natural deodorant.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exfoliating and the toning of the skin<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Kaolin clay cleans the skin of all the dirt, pollution, grime and bacteria without clogging the skin pores and causing breakouts. It also removes off all the dead skin cells without causing any redness or irritation. Additionally, when used regularly, through its stimulation of the skin cells, it also brightens and tones the skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helps to control the oiliness and sooth the rashes: Kaolin Clay can remove excess sebum from the face. It has the properties of clearing the skin pores without getting rid of the natural oils which are good for the skin. Additionally, through its mild <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healing properties <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it can also calm the skin down immediately in case of bug bites or itchy rashes, hence providing temporary relief.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241235 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kaolin-Clay.webp\" alt=\"Kaolin - Clay Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kaolin-Clay.webp 640w, https:\/\/www.gmciltd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kaolin-Clay-480x300.webp 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaolin Clay hence is the clay for those that are gentle, mature and want something natural.
