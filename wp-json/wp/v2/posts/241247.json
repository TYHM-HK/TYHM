It acts as a <\/span><b>filler<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a gripping <\/span><b>absorbent<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that makes the facial makeup <\/span><b>translucent<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>opaque<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This helps the skin feel soft, cool and dry. The <\/span><b>texture<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the mineral is so <\/span><b>silky<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>fine<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it makes the application simple and easy. At the same time, it<\/span><b> prevents skin breakouts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>caking<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: red;\"><b>KAOLIN<\/b>:<\/span> GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is well-suited for <b>sensitive<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><b> dry skin<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

It is <\/span><b>anti-inflammatory<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>relieves<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your skin from rashes and irritation. It helps in avoiding <\/span><b>clogged pores<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and acts as a facial cleanser and <\/span><b>exfoliator<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The mineral&#8217;s naturally fine particles help in preventing frequent skin breakouts.
