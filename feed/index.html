										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI&#8217;s aim is to turn mineral resources into high performance solutions. It produces some of the most essential cosmetic raw materials which have a huge demand due to their exceptional quality. Now, what makes GMCI&#8217;s cosmetic raw materials stand out? Let’s find out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>TALC</b>: </span>GMCI&#8217;s talc is <b>oleophilic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in nature i.e. it has a natural affinity with oil rather than water. It acts as a </span><b>filler</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a gripping </span><b>absorbent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that makes the facial makeup </span><b>translucent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>opaque</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This helps the skin feel soft, cool and dry. The </span><b>texture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mineral is so </span><b>silky</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>fine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it makes the application simple and easy. At the same time, it</span><b> prevents skin breakouts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>caking</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>KAOLIN</b>:</span> GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is well-suited for <b>sensitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><b> dry skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its non</span><b>-abrasive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> property helps to </span><b>tone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the skin. It is </span><b>anti-inflammatory</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>relieves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your skin from rashes and irritation. It helps in avoiding </span><b>clogged pores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and acts as a facial cleanser and </span><b>exfoliator</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The mineral&#8217;s naturally fine particles help in preventing frequent skin breakouts. GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is without fail your go-to </span><b>detoxifier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>CALCIUM CARBONATE</b>: </span>GMCI produces a <b>natural, white and pure </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">calcium carbonate. Its exceptional </span><b>absorbent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> property leaves you with a </span><b>bright</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>glossy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look. In addition to that, it has a gentle, </span><b>soft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>velvety touch </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to it. This mineral has multiple uses. It acts as a </span><b>cleaning agent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in toothpastes and body scrubs, </span><b>opacifying</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><b>whitening agent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in eye shadow, face powder and lipstick as well as serves as a </span><b>pigment extender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>prolonger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is very effective in bath products like bath salts and soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>MICA</b>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GMCI&#8217;s organic mica </span><b>transmits and reflects light</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thus providing a </span><b>glowing effect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resulting in radiant skin. It is suitable for all skin types with no side effects. It has</span><b> anti-inflammatory</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> properties that allows the skin to breathe and at the same time protects it against the environment. It is </span><b>water resistant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and therefore binds to oils rather than to water, altogether making it better for the skin. It also protects the skin against sun damage and doesn’t cause skin breakouts. It causes no discomfort and leaves you with a </span><b>sparkly and shimmery look</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moreover, it is easy to clean off after use and therefore helps in </span><b>avoiding clogged pores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>BENTONITE</b>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GMCI&#8217;s bentonite acts as a </span><b>natural barrier </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">between the skin and the environment. It’s </span><b>viscous</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>water-resistant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nature helps in treating rashes and acne. It acts as a </span><b>detoxifier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and helps in </span><b>improving the quality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the skin by removing toxic impurities. It </span><b>removes blemishes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and evenly tones the skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such significant properties and applications, GMCI continues to lead in this sector. Chemicals might give you results immediately but that is short-lived. Organic and natural is what makes GMCI unique. Here at GMCI, we strive to achieve solutions that have a deep as well as a long-lasting impact.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite- A mineral of many secrets</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which mineral is GMCI the producer, exporter and dealer in India? What are the hidden properties of this mineral?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mineral is a calcium magnesium carbonate and has the chemical formula CaMg (CO3)2. It is found as a major constituent of dolostones and dolomite marbles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term is also used for sedimentary carbonate rock, mainly made up of the dolomite mineral. Dolostone is an alternate name used occasionally for the form of dolomite rock. Dolomite may be colorless, white, pinkish or slightly blue. On the other hand, the crystals of Dolomite may be either transparent, or translucent or even completely opaque. Dolomite is also one of those minerals which makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth’s crust. Additionally, it is also that mineral which cleaves or breaks along smooth planes in three different directions. Collectively though, this barely makes the introduction of dolomite. To give you further insights:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite comes in at 3.5-4 on the Mohs hardness scale. This scale rates how difficult it is to scratch a mineral. Additionally, it is also a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double salt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because it is composed of calcium as well as magnesium such that it has a structure different than either of those individual salts. In this mineral, the calcium and magnesium salts exist in separate layers with the carbonate layers in between them.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite is also used as a source of magnesia (MgO), a feed additive for livestock, a sintering agent and a flux in metal processing. It is also used as an ingredient in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">production of bricks, glass</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ceramics. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite due to its reaction with the acid is also used for acid neutralization in the chemical industry, stream restoration projects and as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">soil conditioner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite powder is also used as a raw material in soap and detergents. In fact, when dolomite is free from iron, it is also used in making of sheet and optical glasses. On the other hand, dolomite marble chips are used for floorings. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the refractory lining in basic open-hearth furnaces and Bessemer converters, dead burned dolomite is used as refractory lining. It is also used as a basic flux in smelting of iron ore in blast furnace, hence removing alumina and slag. Lastly, it is also used in accelerating the vulcanizing process and in decorative building materials and polish. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, while dolomite is not a mineral with wide range of applications, but it is nevertheless is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mineral of many secrets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One that accommodates several of our vital uses, not limiting to dolomite serving as the host rock for many lead, zinc and copper deposits while also serving as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reservoir for oil and gas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At GMCI, dolomite powder has managed to win over large popularity due to the high level of whiteness and purity offered by us. We produce a dolomite powder that retains all of its physical properties of being less reactive, having better acid resistance, having better production rate and lastly, also one that increases the flow rates because of its higher bulk density and Sp. Gravity. All of our customers are duly assured and promised of timely deliveries of the quantities ordered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the GMCI are the producer, dealer and exporter of Dolomite powders in India.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaolin Clay- A Mineral for Keeping</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your skin dry and sensitive and the bentonite clay too harsh for it? here we bring to you something gentler, something softer and smoother to meet all your cosmetics goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaolin Clay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or China Clay is a clay that was first obtained or mined from a hill named “Kaoling” in China. While in China this clay was mostly used for making porcelain and also as a medicine for treating diarrhea, today, it is among the gentlest clay used in skin care. It is white in colour with a very soft texture. Depending upon the different minerals present in it, it can also be greenish or pinkish in colour, though the one which is white is said to be purer and better. It is rich in a mineral named as “Kaolinite.” Kaolin clay has a neutral pH and is rich in silica dioxide. These properties mean that it is gentle on the skin while making it soft and healthy. But that is just a brief, for Kaolin is beneficial in cosmetics in several ways. Some of them are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tooth Cleanser</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin is a popular ingredient in tooth cleansing powder because of its ability to polish and hence whiten the appearance of the teeth. Additionally, because it is abundant in minerals, it can also become a way of remineralizing and strengthening the teeth. Most importantly, it is a completely natural source. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanses Hair: Kaolin clay being gentle benefits dry, brittle hair by cleansing it of all the dirt, impurities and oil without stripping off the natural oils. It also strengthens the roots while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the blood circulation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the scalp. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deodorant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin can detox the underarms to stop odour-causing impurities without using any harsh chemicals. It hence also works as a natural deodorant. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exfoliating and the toning of the skin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin clay cleans the skin of all the dirt, pollution, grime and bacteria without clogging the skin pores and causing breakouts. It also removes off all the dead skin cells without causing any redness or irritation. Additionally, when used regularly, through its stimulation of the skin cells, it also brightens and tones the skin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps to control the oiliness and sooth the rashes: Kaolin Clay can remove excess sebum from the face. It has the properties of clearing the skin pores without getting rid of the natural oils which are good for the skin. Additionally, through its mild </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">healing properties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it can also calm the skin down immediately in case of bug bites or itchy rashes, hence providing temporary relief. </span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper making is an expensive and inefficient task if not done with the perfect raw materials. We at GMCI are all about delivering perfection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">Precipitated Calcium Carbonate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(PCC) is known as purified, refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate, such as limestone, marble </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chalk: CaCO3. Precipitated Calcium Carbonate is produced by moisturizing high-calcium fast lime and then by reacting with carbon dioxide to the resultant slurry, or “lime milk.” In the PCC process, substances varying from ultra-low to very high powder densities may be produced with very limited measurements, high surface areas, higher oil absorption and/or specific powder bulk content. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-241219 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30.png" alt="calcium carbonate 1" width="477" height="357" srcset="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30.png 477w, https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As against the more expensive wood-pulp, additives or other minerals, PPC is the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">cost-effective mineral</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">producing high-quality paper and paperboard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because PCC is manufactured, its chemical and physical properties can be controlled. This means that the PCC produced, can have its properties optimized in terms of its particle size, particle size distribution, surface area, particle shape and surface chemistry to meet the needs of our customers. Also, synthesized PCC is also innately whiter and brighter than other raw minerals used in paper-making like kaolin clay and Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this, PCC is also used in the paper mills as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">filler material </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the alkaline paper-making processes. The main reason behind the preference for PCC is also because of the increasing demands for brighter and bulkier papers. As against GCC, PCC provides </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">better gloss and opacity properties for the paper</span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">, while also being less abrasive than GCC.  Also, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">increases the machine speed and productivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hence simultaneously improving the machine run ability and water drainage. Further on, it not only </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">improves the print quality </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but also reduces fibre consumption as compared to GCC or talc. The higher light scattering ability of PCC, compared to clay, made it possible for papermakers to achieve their opacity and brightness targets without TiO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lastly, it has more retention capacity than the other paper fillers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI being the global manufacturing leader of industrial minerals based in Ahmedabad, India with a commitment to quality and proven track record of more than 14 years, produces and sells 100,000MT 200 meshes to 15000 meshes CaCo3(GCC, PCC, Nano Calcium Carbonate) powder each year. Believing in bridging the gap between quality of products, our product has the reputation of </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">high whiteness and high purity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The PCC powder is widely used in different industries, such as plastic, rubber, EVA, cable, paper, cosmetics, food, pharmaceutical and ceramics. GMCI strongly believes in their responsibility of ensuring a sustainable future and hence takes the necessary steps starting from the safety of its worker till using clean energy sources and reducing the wastes. We, at GMCI are Globally Acclaimed for a reason, or rather for reasons. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come in handy, and for the fact that it covers 4 percent of the Earth&#8217;s surface, it is ideal for beauty purposes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Calcium Carbonate uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> varies from industry to industry,  like paper, paints, inks, pharmaceuticals, and many more, only due to its chalky flavor, fine White powder, and fragrance. Global paper production was estimated at 413 million tons in 2017 compared to 409 in 2016, where the major paper countries were Germany, the US, China, and Japan. With the increase of paper and paper board production will also increase the demand for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it is applied as a coating on the paper to incorporate brightness and opacity. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-241026 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gmci11-300x200.jpg" alt=" Calcium Carbonate " width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>                           </b><b>CALCIUM CARBONATE</b><b> COVERS 4 PERCENT OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE VS CALCIUM CITRATE</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most concentrated form of Calcium is Calcium Carbonate, which is found in Caltrate. Calcium supplements we get in the pharmaceuticals are either made out of Calcium Carbonate or Calcium Citrate, out of which Calcium Carbonate is the most concentrated form. Calcium Carbonate can provide twice the volume of elemental Calcium given out by Calcium Citrate whereas Calcium Citrate can only give out half of the elemental calcium than that given by Calcium Carbonate. Calcium Carbonate can also be produced as a smaller sized tablet, whereas Calcium Citrate requires larger sized tablet to get the amount of elemental calcium.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCITE OR </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE POWDER</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ninety-nine percent of the Calcium Carbonate is Calcite super White Material, mainly found in insecticides and paints. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate formula</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is CaCO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . Calcium Carbonate forms the Calcite powder   or the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate powder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   has been the prime requisite in Plastics, metal polish, cement, and calcium carbide. Calcium carbonate has been a demanding mineral globally to which we cater to comprehensively, and meet the foreign standards. This superior quality of Calcium Carbonate has also managed to keep its compatibility, due to which we stay long-lasting ties with firms around the world and our customers.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE SIDE EFFECTS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AND USES</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate forms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the White Powder, and it is due to its soft, chalky powdered texture that it is a bit dusty and is slightly soluble in water. Calcium Carbonate acts as a significant oil absorber and a mattifying ingredient and price friendly, which is why most of the cosmetic and skincare products have Calcium Carbonate in them and makes it an oil-control work. Still, one needs to be very careful when applying around the eyes as it is high in PH. Calcium Carbonate is also found as a mild abrasive in toothpaste. Calcium Carbonate has been a highly demanded mineral, especially for beauty products. It gives fillers to lipsticks, eye shadow, foundation, face powder, and facial masks, and is used to formulate dry shampoo and solid stick deodorants. Calcium Carbonate may be found in food, but medication is where everyone has to be careful and ensure they consult with a pharmacist, before they use it. The major </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate Side effects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, could hamper your urinal, rapidly gain weight, and high levels of calcium in your blood could also lead to constipation, vomiting, thirst, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nausea, bone pain, frequently feeling tired and mostly devoid of energy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> antacid helps in relieving acid indigestion, heartburn and stomach upset is available in with or without prescription. Any medicine without prescription is prone to vulnerability and same goes for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate Antacid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can lead to side effects like gas, constipation and frequent burping, if not consulted by a pharmacist.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">COUNTRIES WHERE </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IS AT A STAGERRING DEMAND</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France, Singapore, United States, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and China are the top cosmetic producing countries that augmented the demand for Calcium Carbonate. Although they have their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our excellent quality-price compatible with Calcium Carbonate is expected to increase demand in the next few years. France is the top cosmetic trading country globally with a valuation of 10 Billion Dollars worth of exports of the 16 percent total beauty cosmetics and skincare exports.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">MARKET SIZE OF CALCIUM  CARBONATE AND FORECAST</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Market Size of Calcium Carbonate worldwide was valued at 22.95 billion Dollars in 2018, and an estimated 7.4 percent CAGR from 2019 to 2025. It is due to an increase in demand for paper products utilized for hygiene and packaging that has  lead to the growth of the market, and the market size is expected to reach 37.75 billion dollars by 2025 according to the new report of Grand View Research, expanding at a CAGR 7.4 percent.</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bentonite Clay was a miracle mineral formed from a volcanic eruption. Since the formation, it has become useful in a wide variety of products, cement, paper, ceramic, rubber, cosmetics, paint, etc. It is a plastic clay made out of montmorillonite, emerging from the site of volcanic ash. It is known for its colloidal properties, and its thickness is decreased when it is in contact with water, helping it form a glutinous and adhesive material. It has many global markets from countries like Germany, Brazil, Switzerland, and much more demanding such a mineral.</p>

<h2>BENTONITE IS FORMED FROM THE VOLCANO ERUPTION IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER.</h2>
<p>A hydrated silicate mineral with a potential to absorb water swells the absorptive. Bentonite has grabbed the market&#8217;s attention for its ability to be applied in the production of Sodium, Calcium, Aluminium, and potassium, which are the dominant elements of Bentonite. It is the volcanic ash weathering that forms Bentonite in the presence of water. For Industrial purposes, Sodium and Calcium Bentonite are the main classes of Bentonite.</p>
<p>Bentonite has come a long way over geological periods where the Volcanoes emitted some glassy materials, formulated and modified by silica-bearing rocks like granite and basalt. Bentonite comes in the form of natural clay with a soft and delicate structure. The Bentonite Clay indeed creates a paste of the right consistency when mixed with water, can come in handy for both cosmetic or medicinal purposes, and can treat acne, rashes, and can also come in the form of a Bentonite Hair Clay mask. As a mode of consumption, Bentonite can also eliminate some of the digestive issues by eradicating excess toxins from the body. Industries also used bentonite for pond sealingand it proved to be very effective.</p>

<p>Bentonite clay powder  is now ideal for skincare applications because of its stunning absorbing properties. In construction, Bentonite plays the role of a sealing agent. Most of the countries have heightened their demand for Bentonite. Bentonite has accelerated its usage in the application of Lubricant due to its higher viscosity. The United States recognized Bentonite as a mud driller, and since 1990, half of the USA&#8217;s Bentonite produce was used for drilling mud. The GMCI Bentonite has undergone standardized processes. Living up to a positive culture has made us a reliable manufacturer and ensured that the highest foreign standards are met.</p>

<h2><b>End use of </b><b>Bentonite Clay</b><b> applications</b></h2>
<p>The end use of the Bentonite applications, where industries like Pharmaceuticals demand cleansers and the automotive industry demands rubber tires, will increase the market over time. Industries like cosmetics, food, and automotive are expected to give rise to Bentonite&#8217;s newmarket direction in the coming years simply because of its superior binding ability.</p>
<p>The Bentonite market globally was valued at a market size of 1.27 billion in 2015 and anticipated a CAGR of 4.8 percent by 2025, mainly accounting for increased usage of oil well cement and grounding fluid applications. Bentonite will be used increasingly across industries like liquor clarifiers, iron and steel manufacturing binders, groundwater barriers, and many more for the next eight to 10 years.</p>
