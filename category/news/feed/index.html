										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem is the most important aspect to be while making any developments. Sustainable development is in the vogue nowadays due to more awareness amongst people for keeping into consideration the need for future generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mineral resource is the concentration of occurrence of material that is in the earth’s crust in which quality and quantity are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Mineral resources are valuable and legally, technically and economically flexible to extract.  Sustainable development of the mineral resources is thus vital for its existence.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sustainable development of mineral resources:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minerals are non-renewable natural resources that are important for </span><a href="http://www.gmciltd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction, manufacturing and energy industries.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The main purpose of sustainable development is to ensure that the usage of minerals is kept to its minimum amount without impacting economic growth in a negative way. In order to achieve sustainability, the process of recycling, efficient use of minerals and use of alternative materials should be adopted. This will ensure that the environment is protected, and the resources are utilized sustainably. </span></p>

<p>The brightness and opacity of the calcium carbonates make them suitable for use in white and color cosmetics. They can even be considered as an extender of titanium oxide and act as a natural source of calcium. To meet the brightness, polishing, and opacifying requirements of the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/cosmetic/">cosmetic industry</a>, the calcium carbonates are available as limestone and marble based products. While marble-based carbonate exhibits high brightness, low oil absorption and low yellow index, limestone carbonate exhibits homogenous deposit, high brightness, higher yellow index and improved opacity.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>​One of the oldest measures in the fight against pandemics were quarantines, which were first employed during the epidemics that spread around Europe in the XIV Century. Curiously, their name comes from the times of Noah and the 40 days that the flood lasted, and the other 40 days that he had to wait afterwards, until the time was right for normal life to return.</p>
<p>In addition to these measures of contention and isolation, <a href="#">quicklime</a> played an important role in disinfection and was used as a barrier to the growth of bacteria on corpses. More recent examples are the use of <a href="#">lime</a> in the battle against swine fever and bird flu, being applied to dead animals as well as for disinfecting stables, farms, and water supply systems, allowing biosecurity measures to be complied with.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><a href="#">Lime</a> is a natural product that has accompanied human-beings throughout their long history of epidemic controls because until microbiology was developed at the end of the XIX Century the method of spread and transmission of diseases were unknown.</p>
<p>Even with the scientific advances that have been made, and the current level of health and technical knowledge, lime is still a product that is called on to maintain public health and has become an essential product because of its proven efficiency.</p>
<p>During the current socio-healthcare crisis caused by the COVID-19 virus lime and its derivatives are being used in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Waste-water analysis is a key factor in epidemiological monitoring as it can, at all times, guarantee the safety of any water that is recovered and reused. In consequence, the WHO recommends the in-situ use of lime milk in the treatment of septic tanks containing water from patients suspected of having or confirmed cases of coronavirus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The French laboratory Sanofi Pasteur has confirmed that the coronavirus disappears or is inactivated at pH 13-13.5 for 24 hours. Therefore, the use of lime-based paints that reach these very basic pH levels can be used to improve the hygiene of walls and surfaces, something that since time immemorial is a well-known application for lime on buildings all over the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are therefore talking about calcium oxide as a natural product that has proved itself to be one of humanity&#8217;s greatest allies in the battle to stay healthy and which at this very moment in time, in the fight against the latest coronavirus, we are very proud of because <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/">GMCI</a> is the leading producer at international level.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Industrial Minerals form an integral part of our lives. We use them in every aspect of our routine. Industrial minerals are used, either in processed or natural state, to make <a href="#">building materials</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paint-coating/">paint</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/ceramic/">ceramics</a>, <a href="#">glass</a>, <a href="#">plastics</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paper-and-board/">paper</a>, <a href="#">electronics</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/detergent/">detergents</a>, <a href="#">medications and medical devices, and many more industrial and domestic products</a>. Without industrial minerals, a vast range of everyday domestic and vital industrial products would just not exist.</p>
<p>Industrial minerals are generally defined as minerals <a href="#">mined and processed</a> (either from natural sources or synthetically processed) for the value of their <a href="#">non-metallurgical</a> properties, which provides for their use in an extremely wide range of <a href="#">industrial and domestic applications</a>. As a general rule, they can also be defined as being non-metallic, non-fuel minerals. What makes industrial minerals and rocks different from their metallic counterparts is the critical need for development work with the end-users, by which mineral products are tailored based on the variable geological possibilities of each deposit. GMCI produces many of the most widely used minerals such as <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/kaolin/">kaolin</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/mica/">mica</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/">talc</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/calcium-carbonate-2/">calcium carbonate</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/calcium-carbonate-2/">carbonate</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/limestone/">limestone</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/quartz/">quartz</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/feldspar/">feldspar</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/bentonite/">bentonite</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/silica/">silica</a> <a href="#">and so on</a>. Different minerals have different features that differ in <a href="#">physical properties</a>. They are extremely <a href="#">versatile</a> in nature. Certain industrial minerals may have one, two, or maybe up to ten domestic and/or industrial applications. <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/">Talc</a>, for example caters to the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/cosmetic/">cosmetic industry</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/cosmetic/">pharmaceutical industry</a> and <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paper-and-board/">paper industry</a>. There are others like kaolin, mica , bentonite who cater to other industries like <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/rubber/">rubber</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/construction/">construction</a>, <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/agriculture/">agriculture</a> <a href="#">as well as</a> <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paint-coating/">paints and coatings</a>.</p>
<p>Industrial minerals are valued for their <a href="#">physical and chemical properties</a> that make them so useful for so many products, and their <a href="#">price</a> is driven by <a href="#">market demand</a> for these items rather than by commodities exchange markets. Market demand for industrial minerals also influences how they are mined. In essence, wherever there is demand for these industrial and domestic applications, i.e. a market, this will create a trading business specific to that market. The crucial point is that the pattern of industrial minerals trade is utterly dictated by the <a href="#">needs of the population</a> and the <a href="#">performance of the economy</a>, and then combined with <a href="#">mineral availability</a>. The relative importance of industrial minerals to the economy of the various countries<a href="#"> reflects the economic maturity</a> of that country and today they constitute the most important raw materials exploited in the developed industrialized countries. Due to increasing <a href="#">environmental awareness</a>, there is need for utilization of waste materials from mining activities, which are also in the mineral form and can thus be considered as industrial minerals. They are the <a href="#">natural, organic and sustainable</a> alternative.</p>
<p>Industrial minerals are not only important to us because of their uses, they are also responsible for <a href="#">employing people and services</a>, and thus have <a href="#">value</a> in that capacity.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>GMCI&#8217;s aim is to turn mineral resources into high performance solutions. It produces some of the most essential cosmetic raw materials which have a huge demand due to their exceptional quality. Now, what makes GMCI&#8217;s cosmetic raw materials stand out? Let’s find out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/">TALC</a>: GMCI&#8217;s talc is oleophilic in nature i.e. it has a natural affinity with oil rather than water. It acts as a <a href="#">filler</a> and a gripping <a href="#">absorbent</a> that makes the facial makeup <a href="#">translucent</a> and <a href="#">opaque</a>. This helps the skin feel soft, cool and dry. The <a href="#">texture</a> of the mineral is so <a href="#">silky</a> and <a href="#">fine</a> that it makes the application simple and easy. At the same time, it <a href="#">prevents skin breakouts</a> and caking too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/kaolin/">KAOLIN</a>: GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is well-suited for <a href="#">sensitive</a> and <a href="#">dry skin</a>. Its non-<a href="#">abrasive</a> property helps to <a href="#">tone</a> the skin. It is <a href="#">anti-inflammatory</a> and <a href="#">relieves</a> your skin from rashes and irritation. It helps in avoiding <a href="#">clogged pores</a> and acts as a facial cleanser and <a href="#">exfoliator</a>. The mineral&#8217;s naturally fine particleshelp in preventing frequent skin breakouts. GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is without fail your go-to <a href="#">detoxifier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/calcium-carbonate-2/">CALCIUM CARBONATE</a>: GMCI produces a <a href="#">natural, white and pure</a> calcium carbonate.Its exceptional <a href="#">absorbent</a> property leaves you with a <a href="#">bright</a> and <a href="#">glossy</a> look. In addition to that, it has a gentle, <a href="#">soft</a> and <a href="#">velvety touch</a> to it. This mineral has multiple uses. It acts as a <a href="#">cleaning agent</a> in toothpastes and body scrubs,<a href="#">opacifying</a> and a <a href="#">whitening agent</a> in eye shadow, face powder and lipstick as well as serves as a <a href="#">pigment extender</a> and <a href="#">prolonger</a>. It is very effective in bath products like bath salts and soap.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/mica/">MICA</a>: GMCI&#8217;s organic mica<a href="#"> transmits and reflects light</a>, thus providing a <a href="#">glowing effect</a> resulting in radiant skin. It is suitable for all skin types with no side effects. It has <a href="#">anti-inflammatory</a> properties that allows the skin to breathe and at the same time protects it against the environment. It is <a href="#">water resistant</a> and therefore binds to oils rather than to water, altogether making it better for the skin. It also protects the skin against sun damage and doesn’t cause skin breakouts. It causes no discomfort and leaves you with a <a href="#">sparkly and shimmery look</a>. Moreover, it is easy to clean off after use and therefore helps in <a href="#">avoiding clogged pores</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/bentonite/">BENTONITE</a>: GMCI&#8217;s bentonite acts as a <a href="#">natural barrier</a> between the skin and the environment. It’s<a href="#"> viscous</a> and <a href="#">water-resistant</a> nature helps in treating rashes and acne. It acts as a <a href="#">detoxifier</a> and helps in <a href="#">improving the quality</a> of the skin by removing toxic impurities. It <a href="#">removes blemishes</a> and evenly tones the skin.</p>
