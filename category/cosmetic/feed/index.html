										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaolin Clay- A Mineral for Keeping</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your skin dry and sensitive and the bentonite clay too harsh for it? here we bring to you something gentler, something softer and smoother to meet all your cosmetics goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaolin Clay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or China Clay is a clay that was first obtained or mined from a hill named “Kaoling” in China. While in China this clay was mostly used for making porcelain and also as a medicine for treating diarrhea, today, it is among the gentlest clay used in skin care. It is white in colour with a very soft texture. Depending upon the different minerals present in it, it can also be greenish or pinkish in colour, though the one which is white is said to be purer and better. It is rich in a mineral named as “Kaolinite.” Kaolin clay has a neutral pH and is rich in silica dioxide. These properties mean that it is gentle on the skin while making it soft and healthy. But that is just a brief, for Kaolin is beneficial in cosmetics in several ways. Some of them are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tooth Cleanser</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin is a popular ingredient in tooth cleansing powder because of its ability to polish and hence whiten the appearance of the teeth. Additionally, because it is abundant in minerals, it can also become a way of remineralizing and strengthening the teeth. Most importantly, it is a completely natural source. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanses Hair: Kaolin clay being gentle benefits dry, brittle hair by cleansing it of all the dirt, impurities and oil without stripping off the natural oils. It also strengthens the roots while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the blood circulation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the scalp. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deodorant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin can detox the underarms to stop odour-causing impurities without using any harsh chemicals. It hence also works as a natural deodorant. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exfoliating and the toning of the skin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Kaolin clay cleans the skin of all the dirt, pollution, grime and bacteria without clogging the skin pores and causing breakouts. It also removes off all the dead skin cells without causing any redness or irritation. Additionally, when used regularly, through its stimulation of the skin cells, it also brightens and tones the skin. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps to control the oiliness and sooth the rashes: Kaolin Clay can remove excess sebum from the face. It has the properties of clearing the skin pores without getting rid of the natural oils which are good for the skin. Additionally, through its mild </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">healing properties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it can also calm the skin down immediately in case of bug bites or itchy rashes, hence providing temporary relief. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-241235 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kaolin-Clay.webp" alt="Kaolin - Clay Image" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kaolin-Clay.webp 640w, https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kaolin-Clay-480x300.webp 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 640px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaolin Clay hence is the clay for those that are gentle, mature and want something natural. If that is what you want from your cosmetics, this here is your mineral clay for keeping. GMCI, through our promise of delivering high quality goods while catering to the needs of every customer ensures that Kaolin Clay produced by it has naturally fine particles, is non-abrasive, has high brightness and is hydrophilic such that it can easily disperse in water.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bentonite Clay was a miracle mineral formed from a volcanic eruption. Since the formation, it has become useful in a wide variety of products, cement, paper, ceramic, rubber, cosmetics, paint, etc. It is a plastic clay made out of montmorillonite, emerging from the site of volcanic ash. It is known for its colloidal properties, and its thickness is decreased when it is in contact with water, helping it form a glutinous and adhesive material. It has many global markets from countries like Germany, Brazil, Switzerland, and much more demanding such a mineral.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-240994 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Image1-300x159.png" alt="BENTONITE Clay" width="300" height="159" /></p>
<h2>BENTONITE IS FORMED FROM THE VOLCANO ERUPTION IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER.</h2>
<p>A hydrated silicate mineral with a potential to absorb water swells the absorptive. Bentonite has grabbed the market&#8217;s attention for its ability to be applied in the production of Sodium, Calcium, Aluminium, and potassium, which are the dominant elements of Bentonite. It is the volcanic ash weathering that forms Bentonite in the presence of water. For Industrial purposes, Sodium and Calcium Bentonite are the main classes of Bentonite.</p>
<p>Bentonite has come a long way over geological periods where the Volcanoes emitted some glassy materials, formulated and modified by silica-bearing rocks like granite and basalt. Bentonite comes in the form of natural clay with a soft and delicate structure. The Bentonite Clay indeed creates a paste of the right consistency when mixed with water, can come in handy for both cosmetic or medicinal purposes, and can treat acne, rashes, and can also come in the form of a Bentonite Hair Clay mask. As a mode of consumption, Bentonite can also eliminate some of the digestive issues by eradicating excess toxins from the body. Industries also used bentonite for pond sealingand it proved to be very effective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-240995 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image2-200x300.png" alt="Clay" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image2-200x300.png 200w, https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image2.png 314w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>Bentonite clay powder  is now ideal for skincare applications because of its stunning absorbing properties. In construction, Bentonite plays the role of a sealing agent. Most of the countries have heightened their demand for Bentonite. Bentonite has accelerated its usage in the application of Lubricant due to its higher viscosity. The United States recognized Bentonite as a mud driller, and since 1990, half of the USA&#8217;s Bentonite produce was used for drilling mud. The GMCI Bentonite has undergone standardized processes. Living up to a positive culture has made us a reliable manufacturer and ensured that the highest foreign standards are met.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-240996 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image3-300x200.png" alt="Clay 1" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<h2><b>End use of </b><b>Bentonite Clay</b><b> applications</b></h2>
<p>The end use of the Bentonite applications, where industries like Pharmaceuticals demand cleansers and the automotive industry demands rubber tires, will increase the market over time. Industries like cosmetics, food, and automotive are expected to give rise to Bentonite&#8217;s newmarket direction in the coming years simply because of its superior binding ability.</p>
<p>The Bentonite market globally was valued at a market size of 1.27 billion in 2015 and anticipated a CAGR of 4.8 percent by 2025, mainly accounting for increased usage of oil well cement and grounding fluid applications. Bentonite will be used increasingly across industries like liquor clarifiers, iron and steel manufacturing binders, groundwater barriers, and many more for the next eight to 10 years.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/mica/">Mica</a> has evolved to be known as the <a href="#">skincare alphabet</a> of the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/cosmetic/">cosmetic industry</a>. It is called as the ‘<a href="#">nature’s glitter</a>&#8216;. It transmits and reflects light, thus providing a <a href="#">glowing effect</a> resulting in a <a href="#">youthful</a> skin. <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/">GMCI</a> is the <a href="#">leading producer</a> of Mica in the country. Without a doubt, it <a href="#">manufacturers</a> the highest quality there is leaving a <a href="#">long-lasting</a> effect.</p>
<p>Mica acts as a <a href="#">texturizer, filler and thickener</a>. It is commonly used in <a href="#">concealers, blushes, eyeshadows, foundation, beauty creams and natural sunscreens</a>. Since Mica is <a href="#">organic</a> in nature, it appeals to all skin types alike with few or no side effects. It has <a href="#">anti-inflammatory</a> properties that allows the skin to breathe and at the same time protects it against the environment. It makes the skin <a href="#">look alive</a> by enhancing your natural features. Mineral based makeup works well against the conventional cosmetics that consists of various chemicals, oils and additives that may cause severe irritation. This is one of the major concerns when it comes to beauty products. GMCI&#8217;s mica, however, is <a href="#">chemical free</a>. It is water resistant and therefore binds to oils rather than to water, altogether making it better for the skin. It also protects the skin against sun damage and doesn’t cause skin breakouts. Mica is very <a href="#">versatile</a> too. When grounded into fine powder, it can be combined with various ingredients to give rise to a wide range of cosmetic products. By the looks of it, Mica has proven to be the backbone of the cosmetic industry.</p>
<p>Appearances tell a lot about a person. It exudes <a href="#">confidence, boldness and your personality</a> as a whole. Cosmetic products are all in to get there and change the way we look at them. GMCI is drawn towards delivering high performance solutions to tackle technical problems. It focuses on <a href="#">customization</a> of it’s products to give a <a href="#">personalized</a> experience to it’s valuable customers.</p></div>
