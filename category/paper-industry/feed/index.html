										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper making is an expensive and inefficient task if not done with the perfect raw materials. We at GMCI are all about delivering perfection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">Precipitated Calcium Carbonate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(PCC) is known as purified, refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate, such as limestone, marble </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chalk: CaCO3. Precipitated Calcium Carbonate is produced by moisturizing high-calcium fast lime and then by reacting with carbon dioxide to the resultant slurry, or “lime milk.” In the PCC process, substances varying from ultra-low to very high powder densities may be produced with very limited measurements, high surface areas, higher oil absorption and/or specific powder bulk content. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-241219 aligncenter" src="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30.png" alt="calcium carbonate 1" width="477" height="357" srcset="https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30.png 477w, https://www.gmciltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot_30-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As against the more expensive wood-pulp, additives or other minerals, PPC is the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">cost-effective mineral</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">producing high-quality paper and paperboard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because PCC is manufactured, its chemical and physical properties can be controlled. This means that the PCC produced, can have its properties optimized in terms of its particle size, particle size distribution, surface area, particle shape and surface chemistry to meet the needs of our customers. Also, synthesized PCC is also innately whiter and brighter than other raw minerals used in paper-making like kaolin clay and Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this, PCC is also used in the paper mills as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">filler material </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the alkaline paper-making processes. The main reason behind the preference for PCC is also because of the increasing demands for brighter and bulkier papers. As against GCC, PCC provides </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">better gloss and opacity properties for the paper</span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">, while also being less abrasive than GCC.  Also, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">increases the machine speed and productivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hence simultaneously improving the machine run ability and water drainage. Further on, it not only </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">improves the print quality </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but also reduces fibre consumption as compared to GCC or talc. The higher light scattering ability of PCC, compared to clay, made it possible for papermakers to achieve their opacity and brightness targets without TiO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lastly, it has more retention capacity than the other paper fillers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI being the global manufacturing leader of industrial minerals based in Ahmedabad, India with a commitment to quality and proven track record of more than 14 years, produces and sells 100,000MT 200 meshes to 15000 meshes CaCo3(GCC, PCC, Nano Calcium Carbonate) powder each year. Believing in bridging the gap between quality of products, our product has the reputation of </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #2e75b5;">high whiteness and high purity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The PCC powder is widely used in different industries, such as plastic, rubber, EVA, cable, paper, cosmetics, food, pharmaceutical and ceramics. GMCI strongly believes in their responsibility of ensuring a sustainable future and hence takes the necessary steps starting from the safety of its worker till using clean energy sources and reducing the wastes. We, at GMCI are Globally Acclaimed for a reason, or rather for reasons. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Calcium Carbonate has always been the building block material of the industry since the Stone Age. The element is utilized for constructing and manufacturing various industry-related commodities and particularly constructional-based requirements. Calcium Carbonate has supported various constructional projects, including bridges, skyscrapers, buildings, and many more, eventually helping the industry reshape and modify its foundation.]]></description>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Calcium Carbonate is an abundant most mineral on Earth. GMCI has taken up the incredible initiative to deliver standard quality calcium carbonate as a raw material to whichever industry needs it the most. GMCI is a promising organization overstocked with a premium collection of essential elements and raw materials, which they either supply forward or use to manufacture crucial commodities for the market.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Calcium Carbonate supplied by GMCI is further used to manufacture construction materials, paper, rubber molded materials, coatings, paints, and many more applications.<br />Calcium carbonate is a natural mineral obtained from the wealthiest stone belts, white and highly pure. The element is also used for beautification and cosmetic purposes. Since calcium carbonate particles are distributed in a size of 5.5 micrometers, they are available in a white powdered form. Calcium Carbonate comes with a chalky flavor and distinct fragrance. It is water-soluble and therefore portrays how fine its particles are.<br />GMCI obtains calcium carbonate from three different primary forms of rock found in nature: chalk, limestone, and marble. These primary rocks eventually give rise to three different types of calcium carbonate: pure calcium carbonate, ground calcium carbonate, and precipitated calcium carbonate. <br />Pure calcium carbonate consists of 99% finely powdered calcite super white material, commonly used for manufacturing paints and insecticides. Their finely coated powder is also used in plastics, cement, metal polishes, and calcium carbide. GMCI’s Calcium carbonate is of superior quality that produces long-lasting effects and is relatively affordable in the market.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>On the other hand, ground calcium carbonate is made up of natural crystalline stones and calcite available in a chalk shape. Its texture varies from one deposit to another and also varies in color. The element is often known for producing excellent whiteness in the marbles.<br />Last but not least, we have precipitated calcium carbonate, a lime product used for various industrial processes. The substance forms ultra-low and high-density powder within the minimal measurement of its usage and has high surface areas, high oil absorption quality, and specified bulk quantity.<br />Therefore, with efficient particle size distribution, high brightness, and low abrasion, Calcium carbonate becomes the essential element in the industry, affluently supplied by GMCI for manufacturing automotive pipes, ink, leather, paper, paints, cosmetic, textiles, glass, and many more.</p></div>
