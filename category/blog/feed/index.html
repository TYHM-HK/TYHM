										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI&#8217;s aim is to turn mineral resources into high performance solutions. It produces some of the most essential cosmetic raw materials which have a huge demand due to their exceptional quality. Now, what makes GMCI&#8217;s cosmetic raw materials stand out? Let’s find out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>TALC</b>: </span>GMCI&#8217;s talc is <b>oleophilic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in nature i.e. it has a natural affinity with oil rather than water. It acts as a </span><b>filler</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a gripping </span><b>absorbent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that makes the facial makeup </span><b>translucent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>opaque</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This helps the skin feel soft, cool and dry. The </span><b>texture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mineral is so </span><b>silky</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>fine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it makes the application simple and easy. At the same time, it</span><b> prevents skin breakouts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>caking</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>KAOLIN</b>:</span> GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is well-suited for <b>sensitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><b> dry skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its non</span><b>-abrasive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> property helps to </span><b>tone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the skin. It is </span><b>anti-inflammatory</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>relieves</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your skin from rashes and irritation. It helps in avoiding </span><b>clogged pores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and acts as a facial cleanser and </span><b>exfoliator</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The mineral&#8217;s naturally fine particles help in preventing frequent skin breakouts. GMCI&#8217;s kaolin is without fail your go-to </span><b>detoxifier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>CALCIUM CARBONATE</b>: </span>GMCI produces a <b>natural, white and pure </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">calcium carbonate. Its exceptional </span><b>absorbent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> property leaves you with a </span><b>bright</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>glossy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look. In addition to that, it has a gentle, </span><b>soft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>velvety touch </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to it. This mineral has multiple uses. It acts as a </span><b>cleaning agent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in toothpastes and body scrubs, </span><b>opacifying</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><b>whitening agent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in eye shadow, face powder and lipstick as well as serves as a </span><b>pigment extender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>prolonger</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is very effective in bath products like bath salts and soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>MICA</b>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GMCI&#8217;s organic mica </span><b>transmits and reflects light</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, thus providing a </span><b>glowing effect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resulting in radiant skin. It is suitable for all skin types with no side effects. It has</span><b> anti-inflammatory</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> properties that allows the skin to breathe and at the same time protects it against the environment. It is </span><b>water resistant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and therefore binds to oils rather than to water, altogether making it better for the skin. It also protects the skin against sun damage and doesn’t cause skin breakouts. It causes no discomfort and leaves you with a </span><b>sparkly and shimmery look</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moreover, it is easy to clean off after use and therefore helps in </span><b>avoiding clogged pores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: red;"><b>BENTONITE</b>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> GMCI&#8217;s bentonite acts as a </span><b>natural barrier </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">between the skin and the environment. It’s </span><b>viscous</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>water-resistant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nature helps in treating rashes and acne. It acts as a </span><b>detoxifier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and helps in </span><b>improving the quality</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the skin by removing toxic impurities. It </span><b>removes blemishes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and evenly tones the skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such significant properties and applications, GMCI continues to lead in this sector. Chemicals might give you results immediately but that is short-lived. Organic and natural is what makes GMCI unique. Here at GMCI, we strive to achieve solutions that have a deep as well as a long-lasting impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMCI </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come in handy, and for the fact that it covers 4 percent of the Earth&#8217;s surface, it is ideal for beauty purposes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Calcium Carbonate uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> varies from industry to industry,  like paper, paints, inks, pharmaceuticals, and many more, only due to its chalky flavor, fine White powder, and fragrance. Global paper production was estimated at 413 million tons in 2017 compared to 409 in 2016, where the major paper countries were Germany, the US, China, and Japan. With the increase of paper and paper board production will also increase the demand for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it is applied as a coating on the paper to incorporate brightness and opacity. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>                           </b><b>CALCIUM CARBONATE</b><b> COVERS 4 PERCENT OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE VS CALCIUM CITRATE</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most concentrated form of Calcium is Calcium Carbonate, which is found in Caltrate. Calcium supplements we get in the pharmaceuticals are either made out of Calcium Carbonate or Calcium Citrate, out of which Calcium Carbonate is the most concentrated form. Calcium Carbonate can provide twice the volume of elemental Calcium given out by Calcium Citrate whereas Calcium Citrate can only give out half of the elemental calcium than that given by Calcium Carbonate. Calcium Carbonate can also be produced as a smaller sized tablet, whereas Calcium Citrate requires larger sized tablet to get the amount of elemental calcium.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">      </span><b>CALCIUM CARBONATE</b><b> SUPPLEMENTS</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCITE OR </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE POWDER</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ninety-nine percent of the Calcium Carbonate is Calcite super White Material, mainly found in insecticides and paints. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate formula</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is CaCO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . Calcium Carbonate forms the Calcite powder   or the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate powder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   has been the prime requisite in Plastics, metal polish, cement, and calcium carbide. Calcium carbonate has been a demanding mineral globally to which we cater to comprehensively, and meet the foreign standards. This superior quality of Calcium Carbonate has also managed to keep its compatibility, due to which we stay long-lasting ties with firms around the world and our customers.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE SIDE EFFECTS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AND USES</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate forms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the White Powder, and it is due to its soft, chalky powdered texture that it is a bit dusty and is slightly soluble in water. Calcium Carbonate acts as a significant oil absorber and a mattifying ingredient and price friendly, which is why most of the cosmetic and skincare products have Calcium Carbonate in them and makes it an oil-control work. Still, one needs to be very careful when applying around the eyes as it is high in PH. Calcium Carbonate is also found as a mild abrasive in toothpaste. Calcium Carbonate has been a highly demanded mineral, especially for beauty products. It gives fillers to lipsticks, eye shadow, foundation, face powder, and facial masks, and is used to formulate dry shampoo and solid stick deodorants. Calcium Carbonate may be found in food, but medication is where everyone has to be careful and ensure they consult with a pharmacist, before they use it. The major </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate Side effects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, could hamper your urinal, rapidly gain weight, and high levels of calcium in your blood could also lead to constipation, vomiting, thirst, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nausea, bone pain, frequently feeling tired and mostly devoid of energy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> antacid helps in relieving acid indigestion, heartburn and stomach upset is available in with or without prescription. Any medicine without prescription is prone to vulnerability and same goes for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate Antacid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can lead to side effects like gas, constipation and frequent burping, if not consulted by a pharmacist.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">COUNTRIES WHERE </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CALCIUM CARBONATE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IS AT A STAGERRING DEMAND</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France, Singapore, United States, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and China are the top cosmetic producing countries that augmented the demand for Calcium Carbonate. Although they have their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calcium Carbonate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our excellent quality-price compatible with Calcium Carbonate is expected to increase demand in the next few years. France is the top cosmetic trading country globally with a valuation of 10 Billion Dollars worth of exports of the 16 percent total beauty cosmetics and skincare exports.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">MARKET SIZE OF CALCIUM  CARBONATE AND FORECAST</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Market Size of Calcium Carbonate worldwide was valued at 22.95 billion Dollars in 2018, and an estimated 7.4 percent CAGR from 2019 to 2025. It is due to an increase in demand for paper products utilized for hygiene and packaging that has  lead to the growth of the market, and the market size is expected to reach 37.75 billion dollars by 2025 according to the new report of Grand View Research, expanding at a CAGR 7.4 percent.</span></div>
