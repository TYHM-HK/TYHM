				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>This elementary layered sheet of hydrated silicate magnesium has basal surfaces that do not contain any active ions because of the layers of magnesium oxygen and hydroxyl octahedron sandwiches between the Silicon Oxygen Tetrahedron layers, which all in all explains the reason GMCI Talc is more inert and hydrophobic. In this regard, GMCI has made sure not to contaminate the Talc with other minerals as it could badly affect the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/"><strong>Talc Product</strong></a> color.</p>
<p>It is the Talc in products like rubber, paint, paper, and cosmetic that makes it an integral part of everyone’s life, and Talcum powder is the most common of Talc, is a form of crushed white powder possessing the ability for moisture, oil, and odor absorption. By serving as a lubricant, it gives the human skin an astringent effect. It is the ability to survive in high temperatures, which makes the Talc Mineral utilized as a lubricant. It is a good moisture absorber and provides assistance in cutting down friction, which is the utmost reason behind keeping the skin dry and devoid of any rashes.</p></div>

This would give paper industries a significant boom in the market and perhaps sell a significant number of stocks. Talc product has also been used as a mode of consumption, and it is used in a variety of food items like chewing gum and rice polish, mainly for its anti-stick coating agent.</p></div>

The <strong>Talc production World Wide</strong> and consumption has increased at a staggering rate. In the year 2012, Talc was valued at 17 Million Dollars for producing 515000 metric tons of Talc and followed by China, the leading Talc producer with an estimate of 2.2 million metric tons, followed by India, the USA, Finland, and France. With Construction and manufacturing expected to increase in the future, the expected Global Talc market is expected to touch 1.7 billion worldwide by the year 2021 compared to 7.4 million in 2012 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3 percent from the year 2016 to 2021.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>“<a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/calcium-carbonate-2/">Calcium carbonates for high stability and gloss</a>”</h2>
<p>At GMCI, Calcium Carbonates are extensively utilized for the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paint-coating/">paint and coating industry</a> in order to manufacture powder coatings and Emulsion paint. The calcium carbonates, with ideal distribution and high whiteness, enhance the processability features of the paint. The stability and gloss can be enhanced as it acts as an anti-setting mediator and an opacity agent.</p>
<p><strong>High environmental resistance and improved performance:</strong></p>
<p>Calcium carbonate has the main property of reducing and enhancing the gloss in the product. It is the most versatile inorganic filler. It is a non-toxic, odorless, non-irritating white powder. GMCI, being the pioneer in providing an extensive range of standards with high quality, makes sure that the products are free from adulterants and impurities. Calcium carbonate used in the paint and coating industry depicts the same as it is neutral in nature I.e.it is free from impurities.</p>
<p><strong>There are various Uses of calcium carbonates in the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/paint-coating/">paint and coating industry</a>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heavy calcium:</strong><br />It is a body pigment that has the ability to make the product fine, uniform, and white. The covering effect of the titanium dioxide can be improved when the particle size is close to the particle size of titanium dioxide. The dry hiding power in calcium carbonates uses ultra-fine products. It improves the strength, water resistance, dryness, and scrub resisting of the painting film. <br />The calcium also helps in improving the color retention of the paint which is mainly used in old and new buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Light calcium:</strong><br />Light calcium is equally important in the industry because it plays a role of anti-settling by using the suspension property moreover, the density of such calcium is low which helps in reducing the costs.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>All in all, calcium carbonates act as an extender that either reduces or enhances gloss in the product because of which it can easily be modified. Calcium carbonates are most importantly used as Interior wall paints because it significantly improves the paint properties like sheen, opacity, and wear resistance.</p>
<p>It can also be used as an industrial product at GMCI. Industrial coatings are primarily utilized for protection against extensive environmental conditions by focusing on durability. Calcium carbonate is used to adjust the gloss level in the application such as powder coatings. The functional property of the calcium carbonate is increasing in importance as the market for adhesives and sealant products advance. Not only that, calcium carbonate is used in textured plasters that require coarse particles with high brightness to meet the optical needs of the customers.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><a href="#">​Kaolin Clay</a> is a hydrated silicate aluminium crystalline material, which is produced over millions of years by the hydrothermal decomposition of granite minerals, or ‘china clay,’ as it is widely called. It is a soft, earthy, usually white mineral which in many parts of the world is colored pink-orange-red by iron oxide. Sometimes, alternating layers are found. Commercial Kaolin at GMCI is supplied and transported as a dry powder, with naturally fine particles. It is refractory and remains white after calcination. Additionally, the Kaolin produced by GMCI is hydrophilic and can be easily dispersed in water, while also being a weak conductor for electricity and heat. Additionally, it also has high brightness and is non-abrasive.</p>
<p>Kaolin is one of the most<a href="#"> indispensable fillers in the paint industry</a>. The industrial Kaolin affects the quality and performance of the paint significantly while it also reduces the cost of formulation. It also has several other advantages like<a href="#"> improved film formation</a>, rapid collapse prevention, <a href="#">increased weather resistance</a>, and also consequently reducing the rate of passage of moisture. It also gives a high gloss. Similarly, Kaolin is an important part of the coatings industry as well. In the case of architectural coatings, Kaolin offers increased opacity and tint strength, <a href="#">stain and scrub resistance</a>, improved pigment suspension, sheen control, and improved holdout. It is hence an economical and excellent extender that helps in keeping the manufacturing costs of architectural paints and coatings down.</p>
<p>Kaolin also plays an important role in the manufacturing of primers by giving tank stability, film smoothness, <a href="#">corrosion resistance</a>, edge film builds, and uniformity. For automotive primers, Kaolin products are characterized by low salt content, easy dispersion, good throwing power, and proven performance. Coming to industrial coatings, Kaolin is used extensively in high-performance settings and especially where durability is the key. This includes traffic paint, textured paint, baking enamels, and coil coatings. It hence ensures consistent performance and durability until the finish. Lastly, in the case of printing inks, Kaolin though is used in very small proportions, is still very vital because it can extend resin cost-effectively, while also improving holdout, maintaining the ink gloss, and extending colored pigments. Easy dispersibility, low abrasion, and low oil absorption are the other advantages of Kaolin in inks.</p>
<p>Kaolin clay, hence is that mineral which again has it benefits across several industries while being the most essential component for productions in paint and coatings industry. At GMCI, we listen to the needs of our clients and provide them an outstanding selection of Kaolin Clays. Developed by our experts, using superior ingredients, the Kaolin we produce is of a quality that cannot be beaten easily.</p></div>
