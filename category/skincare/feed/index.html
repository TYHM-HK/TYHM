				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Kaolin, also known as China Clay, is a common mineral. It has the kaolinite as a primary constituent. However, the kaolinite is a hydrous aluminum silicate produced by the decomposition of granite minerals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pure kaolinite often has a bright white color. In case it has a reddish or yellowish hue, this is due to the presence of iron oxide. Besides, it is rich in zinc, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, etc.</em></p>
<p>Kaolin has diverse applications in several products such as paint, paper, insulated cable as well as fertilizers. Though, kaolin is very popular in cosmetics and personal care products.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kaolin in Beauty Care and Cosmetics Products</strong></p>
<p>Kaolin is an excellent mineral that forms the <a href="#">base of many beauty products</a>. However, when used in a specific form such as powder, it mixes with essential oils and other ingredients to create a <a href="#">beauty product of pure elegance</a>.</p>
<p>The skincare products loaded with the <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/kaolin/">Kaolin</a> are <a href="#">suitable for dry skins</a> as they possess strong absorbent characteristics.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="#">kaolin contains tiny particles</a> when it is available in the form of a powder that gives it the granular feature. This makes it a great ingredient to furnish the exfoliating products, specifically in the form of a <a href="#">paste</a>.</p>
<p>Being the softest clay, Kaolin clay does not absorb the skin&#8217;s own moisture and keeps the skin not turning red as compared to the bentonite clay or illite clay. Besides, the softness of <a href="#">clay</a> makes it ideal for <a href="http://3" data-wplink-url-error="true" target="_blank">childcare products</a> such as <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/">talc</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="#">kaolin has an anti-inflammatory influence</a>, which decreases the redness and inflammation of established blemishes. Kaolin is the primary ingredient of cosmetics products including face powder and the foundation. Its absorbent feature allows it to <a href="#">soak the excess waterand oil</a> over the face that keeps the makeup not being caked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Being an industry leader, GMCI has been providing the Kaolin to essential manufacturing businesses including cosmetics while adhering to the standards strictly.</em></p></div>
