It can be green, white, grey, brown, or colorless. It is a monoclinic mineral with a sheet structure having perfect cleavage that follows planes between the weakly bonded sheets. The talc sheets are strongly bonded to each other by Van der Waals bonds allowing them to slip past one another. This gives the Talc mineral an extremely soft, greasy and soapy feel.</p>
<p>GMCI Talc is found in nature with other minerals in the form of rocks known as soapstone, steatite or talc schist. The chemical composition of Talc is Mg3Si4O10(OH)2.</p>
<p>GMCI <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/talc/">Talc</a> mineral is produced from an open-pit mine where the rocks are drilled, blasted and partially crushed during the mining. We apply selective mining and sorting operations for the highest grade ores.</p>
<p>During the mining process, GMCI makes sure that the talc is not contaminated with other minerals as contamination can badly affect the color of the product.</p>
<p>Partially crushed talc mineral rock is taken from mine to mill, where it is further broken down in size. We at GMCI apply several methods to remove impurities. We produce talc in various forms as per our customer’s requirements for particle size, brightness, composition, and other properties.</p></div>
