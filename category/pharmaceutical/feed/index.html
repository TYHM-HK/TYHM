<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized medicine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is viewed as one of the most futuristic aspects of the developing system.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists quote that “One might say that emerging technologies, including continuous manufacturing, advanced process analytics and control, and new manufacturing paradigms-including 3D printing and portable/modular systems-will be essential to the advancement of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized medicine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, of course, there will be regulatory challenges in the change from bulk manufacturing a one-size-fits-all medicine to a system of more localized manufacturing.”</span></p>
