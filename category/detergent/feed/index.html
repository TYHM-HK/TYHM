										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite- A mineral of many secrets</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which mineral is GMCI the producer, exporter and dealer in India? What are the hidden properties of this mineral?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mineral is a calcium magnesium carbonate and has the chemical formula CaMg (CO3)2. It is found as a major constituent of dolostones and dolomite marbles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term is also used for sedimentary carbonate rock, mainly made up of the dolomite mineral. Dolostone is an alternate name used occasionally for the form of dolomite rock. Dolomite may be colorless, white, pinkish or slightly blue. On the other hand, the crystals of Dolomite may be either transparent, or translucent or even completely opaque. Dolomite is also one of those minerals which makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth’s crust. Additionally, it is also that mineral which cleaves or breaks along smooth planes in three different directions. Collectively though, this barely makes the introduction of dolomite. To give you further insights:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite comes in at 3.5-4 on the Mohs hardness scale. This scale rates how difficult it is to scratch a mineral. Additionally, it is also a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double salt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because it is composed of calcium as well as magnesium such that it has a structure different than either of those individual salts. In this mineral, the calcium and magnesium salts exist in separate layers with the carbonate layers in between them.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite is also used as a source of magnesia (MgO), a feed additive for livestock, a sintering agent and a flux in metal processing. It is also used as an ingredient in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">production of bricks, glass</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ceramics. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite due to its reaction with the acid is also used for acid neutralization in the chemical industry, stream restoration projects and as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">soil conditioner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolomite powder is also used as a raw material in soap and detergents. In fact, when dolomite is free from iron, it is also used in making of sheet and optical glasses. On the other hand, dolomite marble chips are used for floorings. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the refractory lining in basic open-hearth furnaces and Bessemer converters, dead burned dolomite is used as refractory lining. It is also used as a basic flux in smelting of iron ore in blast furnace, hence removing alumina and slag. Lastly, it is also used in accelerating the vulcanizing process and in decorative building materials and polish. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, while dolomite is not a mineral with wide range of applications, but it is nevertheless is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mineral of many secrets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One that accommodates several of our vital uses, not limiting to dolomite serving as the host rock for many lead, zinc and copper deposits while also serving as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reservoir for oil and gas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At GMCI, dolomite powder has managed to win over large popularity due to the high level of whiteness and purity offered by us. We produce a dolomite powder that retains all of its physical properties of being less reactive, having better acid resistance, having better production rate and lastly, also one that increases the flow rates because of its higher bulk density and Sp. Gravity. All of our customers are duly assured and promised of timely deliveries of the quantities ordered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the GMCI are the producer, dealer and exporter of Dolomite powders in India.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>The detergent industry is thus going to see enormous growth in the coming years. The growth of the detergent industry is influenced by certain ongoing trends that will change the composition of the detergents making them more sustainable, effective and suitable for technological advancements.</p>
<p><strong>SUSTAINABLE DETERGENTS</strong></p>
<p>Today, the world is shifting to sustainable products for a better tomorrow. Consumers are now becoming more aware and prefer to use products that are sustainable as well as safe for the environment. Thus a detergent must be able to comply with such requirements. This gives rise to the use of surfactants derived from natural oils instead of petroleum.</p>
<p><strong>RAW MATERIAL COST</strong></p>
<p>The detergent industry has become competitive since last few years. Competition has been a key driver in determining the price of the detergents by the detergent brands. The raw material of detergents is mainly derived from petroleum, thus making it’s cost highly dependent on the volatile oil industry. Such dependence and increasing competition have put a sudden pressure on the detergent industry to derive their raw materials from alternatives that are cost-effective and environment friendly.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Technology is advancing swiftly and is moving towards more environmentally friendly measures. Advance washing machines use relatively less water resulting in the formulation of new high-efficiency detergents. The chances are high of consumers changing to newer energy-saving machines driving the manufacturers of detergents towards designing detergents for low-water and cold-water washing.</p>
<p><strong>STRINGENT POLICIES</strong></p>
<p>Stringent Policies have been adopted to ensure less pollution due to discharge of wastewater. This has put increased scrutiny on the raw materials of the detergent industry. GMCI’s raw materials comply with all stringent policies put in force by the detergent association.</p>
<p>The detergent industry is thus growing fourfold under a strict environment for a sustainable future.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>A material for <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/detergent/">detergent</a> builder has to possess hard water softening property and alkalinity-giving property to washing water. <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/">GMCI</a>&#8216;s A type of <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/synthetic-zeolite-zeolite-4a/">zeolite</a> indicates an excellent ion-exchange capacity and hard water softening property among other zeolites. Zeolites act as a <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/detergent/">builder for detergents</a> that not only perform significant functions in the production process but also help in inhibition of greying and removal of dirt. As a <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/detergent/">detergent</a> builder, GMCI&#8217;s Zeolite type A was developed specifically as an environmentally preferable alternative to phosphate builders, which can cause eutrophication of freshwater bodies by nourishing excessive amounts of algae.</p>
<p>The application of GMCI&#8217;s zeolites in detergent production has numerous advantages over other detergent builders. They have enhanced product stability regardless of the particular process employed (spray drying, granulation, extrusion), are inert when exposed to high temperature or alkalinity. The high flexibility of zeolite with respect to formulation and ease of processing together with the economic advantage of the raw material have led to it becoming an extremely <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/detergent/">attractive builder</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gmciltd.com">GMCI</a> has been actively involved in development and production of <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/synthetic-zeolite-zeolite-4a/">zeolite</a> products. We continue to provide various kind of <a href="https://www.gmciltd.com/synthetic-zeolite-zeolite-4a/">zeolite</a> products for our customers.</p></div>
